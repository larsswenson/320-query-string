Handling query strings in Express

Route accepts query strings via URL GET requests and logs them to console.

Throws a 404 error if entry is invalid.

Enter various query strings after http://localhost:3000/get? in URL and check console to see them logged. Any string input should work.  

Requires Node.js and npm.
Make sure to include "type": "module" in the package.json file and to install Express, via "npm install express".
To run server, navigate to "query_strings" directory via "cd query_strings" in the terminal.
Run "node index.js" to start server. The console will read, "Server listening on port 3000".
